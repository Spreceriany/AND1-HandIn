The application I'll be working on will be a wiki of my favorite game Death Stranding. 
The reason for making this app is because the story of Death Stranding is quite vast and there's lot of information to learn. With this app, players will be able to have the information right in their pocket without a need of internet connection.
MoSCoW requirements:

- MUST HAVE 
- - Categories by which user can learn information about the story, charactes, equipment etc.
- - A navigation for quick search for a desired topic

- SHOULD HAVE 
- - Sharing a particular information with an friend on social medias

- COULD HAVE

- - Save information to read later
- - Bookmark particular text so user will know where he ended up reading

- WON'T HAVE 
- - A registration
- - A login
